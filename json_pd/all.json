Often, we eagerly anticipate beginnings like New Year's resolutions, new jobs, or relocation to new environments. Yet, sometimes the starting over process can be more challenging than promising.</em></strong> </p>\n<p><strong><em>The question is, how do we navigate these scenarios without losing ourselves in the process? How do we extract something positive from such experiences?</em></strong></p>\n<p>The answer might not be as complex as you might imagine. It isn't merely about adopting a fresh mindset, although that can be beneficial. At times, it takes a bit more effort to transition from endings to new beginnings. Here's how.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beginwithbiddingfarewell\">Begin with Bidding Farewell</h3>\n<p>A moment will come when you'll have to release the past to embrace what lies ahead. How you choose to do this is entirely up to you. You might find comfort in journaling about your past, or perhaps a discussion could aid your healing process. Depending on the circumstances, counseling could be a worthy consideration. Regardless of your choice, ensure you take the time to process. Unpacking some baggage might take longer than others, so don't rush the healing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"huntforthesilverlining\">Hunt for the Silver Lining</h3>\n<p>Maybe this fresh start wasn't your priority, but that doesn't mean it lacks potential. Use it as an opportunity to achieve something you've been meaning to do. Look for the good within the situation. You might even find reasons to celebrate this fresh start you hadn't initially considered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getyourheadinthegame\">Get Your Head in the Game</h3>\n<p>Once you start facing forward, assess the situation. Identify your options, your obligations, and your aspirations. A fresh start gives you a perfect chance to rectify more than just what's necessary. </p>\n<h3 id=\"giveyourselfarealitycheck\">Give Yourself a Reality Check</h3>\n<p>Of course, not every wish list item can be addressed immediately. Some might need financial or other resources you currently lack. Some could potentially overwhelm you if you attempted too many new beginnings at once. There's wisdom in pacing yourself and not setting yourself up for failure. So, what's realistic?</p>\n<h3 id=\"reflectonlessonslearned\">Reflect on Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>If you find yourself thrust into a significant change, there's a chance your previous situation didn't pan out as you'd hoped. The silver lining? You can still extract positive insights from that experience. </p>\n<h3 id=\"ownyourfreshstart\">Own Your Fresh Start</h3>\n<p>It's common to resist being dictated to. If this fresh start feels imposed upon you, it's easy to harbor resentment and anger, irrespective of the positive aspects you've discovered or the goals you've set. There comes a point where you need to step back, embrace the situation, and say, \"Yes, I do want a fresh start,\" thereby making it your choice. This approach restores control, ensuring that what follows aligns with your desires.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reorientyourmindset\">Reorient Your Mindset</h3>\n<p>A successful fresh start will be challenging if you're holding onto anger or resentment. This is particularly true if the change feels imposed. You might have to engage in things you'd rather not, at least initially. However, that doesn't mean you can't embrace the change and extract some good from it. Begin by envisioning the best outcomes. To further adjust your perspective, list all the positive things that could arise from this fresh start. Identify an outcome that excites you and can make you feel at least better about this fresh start, if not excited.</p>","data":{"title":"Fresh Start","subTitle":"Restart & Refresh","excerpt":"Not every fresh start comes from a place of choice","featureImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/seventh-ave-inc/image/upload/v1686102884/Restart_gfi0q5.png","date":"06/06/2023","order":1},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","path":"/Users/bigpoppacode/code/bigpoppacode.io/api_pd/fresh-start.md","_id":"fresh-start"}]
