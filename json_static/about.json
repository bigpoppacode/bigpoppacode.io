And he is always looking to push himself and his skills to the next level. His skills as a manager and helping a group stay on task are extremely effective. Arthur approaches this task not by micromanaging, but by being an open communicator, positive influence, and leading by example. His presence in the classroom at GA surely elevated my skills and attitude about the craft of programming, and my experience would not have been the same without him there.\"</h5>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n<p></div></p>","data":{"title":"About Me","subTitle":"'Technical Co-Founder and Head of Engineering at Seventh Ave. Inc   & SEI Instructional Lead at General Assembly'","excerpt":"This is the About Page","featureImage":"/img/profile.jpg","date":"10/21/21"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","path":"/Users/bigpoppacode/code/bigpoppacode.io/api_static/about.md","_id":"about"}
