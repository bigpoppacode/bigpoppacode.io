I have been through alot of obstacles in my life, some of those\nobstacles were placed by others and some of those were self imposed, but if your falling from a cliff in the moment it\ndoesn't matter why you are falling, whether you jumped, you tripped or someone pushed you, if you realize you want to\nsurvive you need to act. Code was my way out and it also became a way to express myself and a way to create generational wealth, and I want to help others do the same thing. I've always wanted to help people and have always tried and now I am going to place as much of my effort into helping people this way.\n</div>\n\n</div>","data":{"title":"Start Here","subTitle":"An Introduction to Deeper Than Code","excerpt":"I want to be the best.
